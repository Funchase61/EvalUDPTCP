## Introduction

<p>Welcome, everyone! Today, we're going to dive into a set of exercises focused on fundamental networking protocols: TCP/IP, UDP, and ARP requests. These protocols play a crucial role in communication across networks, from ensuring reliable data transmission to handling address resolution. Through these exercises, you'll gain a better understanding of how they function, their differences, and their practical applications. Let's get started! 
  
TLDR : you'll need to download Cisco Packet Tracer to do this exercices, and some VMs on Windows server iso</p>
