## Introduction

<p>Welcome, everyone! Today, we're going to dive into a set of exercises focused on fundamental networking protocols: TCP/IP, UDP, and ARP requests. These protocols play a crucial role in communication across networks, from ensuring reliable data transmission to handling address resolution. Through these exercises, you'll gain a better understanding of how they function, their differences, and their practical applications. Let's get started! 
  
TLDR : you'll need to download Cisco Packet Tracer to do this exercices, and some VMs on Windows server iso</p>

## Manipulations list

### First exercice : creating our local network with working routing

So it's time to introduce ourselves to Cisco Packet Tracer ! Download it and open it.

When it's done, now we need to create our "simulation" of what is our network in our facility, so for that we'll need to install equipments. In our case we'll need to have 3 computer , 3 servers , 1 switch , 3 routers.

For Context : Our Facility have 3 anchors ( admin, technical, marketing ) each one have his own sub-network :

- Technical : 192.168.1.0/24
- Marketing : 192.168.2.0/24
- Admin : 192.168.3.0/24

each one have his own router and server to permits routing and Ip distribution by DHCP

### 1. First step : 

Create our work environment, it should look like this :
